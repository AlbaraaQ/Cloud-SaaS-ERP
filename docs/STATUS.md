# Status Ledger

| Phase | Date | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PHASE_01 | 2026-08-23 | COMPLETE | Repository and engineering standards bootstrap. Re-audited on 2026-09-04: the phase was **present but over-claimed** — `.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierignore`, `.lintstagedrc.json`, `.gitleaksignore`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and every `.env.example` were missing from the commit and have since been created. |
| PHASE_02 | 2026-09-04 | COMPLETE | Backend platform core (NestJS bootstrap, request pipeline, contracts/config/database packages, health probes). Originally reported `IN_PROGRESS` on 2026-09-01; the phase **failed its own acceptance bar** (`npm run verify` never reached lint/unit/integration/build) and was completed during the Phase 03 pass. See `PHASE_02_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`. |
| PHASE_03 | 2026-09-04 | COMPLETE | Tenancy, Identity & Access: 9-table platform/tenancy schema with reversible idempotent migration, RLS on all tenant-scoped tables, `api`/`migrator` database roles, auth (login/refresh/logout/change-password), RBAC, typed tenant settings, guard pipeline, isolation harness. `pnpm run verify` exits 0. See `PHASE_03_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`. |

## Phase-01 Notes

- Monorepo skeleton created with `apps/{api,admin,customer,migrator}` and `packages/{database,contracts,config,testing}`.
- Shared TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and workspace configuration established.
- Money guard and env/config skeleton added in the shared config package.
- Docker compose skeleton for postgres, redis, minio, and mailhog added.
- Verify script is wired to run the project bootstrap checks and smoke test.
- No runtime application modules or database schema were created, in line with Phase 01 scope.

## Phase-02 Notes

- NestJS platform bootstrap implemented at the API app boundary: `RequestIdMiddleware` →
  helmet/CORS → global `api/v1` prefix → zod pipes → RFC 9457 `application/problem+json`
  exception filter → request-context and idempotency interceptors.
- `packages/contracts` (error codes, problem shape, pagination/filter/sort helpers,
  permission registry, request-id), `packages/config` (env schema, tenant-settings
  registry) and `packages/database` (Drizzle client, migration runner, CLI) established.
- `/health/live` and `/health/ready` outside the versioned prefix.
- Completed items that Phase 02 had left open: ESLint flat config that actually runs,
  coverage/tooling config, the generated `packages/contracts/openapi.json` artifact, and
  `docs/PHASE_02_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`.

## Phase-03 Notes

- Schema: `tenants, users, memberships, roles, permissions, role_permissions,
  membership_roles, refresh_tokens, tenant_settings` + `erp_migrations`, applied by
  `packages/database/migrations/0000_platform_identity.sql` (267 lines) with a reversible
  counterpart in `migrations/down/`. Verified idempotent (apply → skip) and reversible
  (down → re-apply) against a real PostgreSQL 16 cluster.
- RLS `ENABLE` + `FORCE` on `memberships, roles, role_permissions, membership_roles,
  tenant_settings`; `refresh_tokens`, `tenants`, `users`, `permissions` stay platform-wide.
- Roles: `erp_api` (NOBYPASSRLS, pinned on every migration run) and `erp_migrator`
  (BYPASSRLS, migration-only), created `NOLOGIN` in SQL; `LOGIN` + password only from
  `pnpm db:roles` so no credential is ever written into a migration.
- Guard pipeline frozen by `API_ARCHITECTURE §2` and asserted by `app.module.spec.ts`:
  `RateLimitGuard → AuthGuard → TenantGuard (RLS GUC) → BranchScopeGuard → PermissionsGuard`.
- Auth: RS256 access tokens (15 min, `sub/tid/mid/scope/jti`), 256-bit rotating refresh
  tokens stored as SHA-256, family revocation on reuse, Argon2id `m=65536,t=3,p=4`,
  lockout after 5 failures, 10/min login bucket, 423 for a suspended tenant, 403 for a
  forged `tid`.
- Testing: `packages/testing` provides the `TESTING_STRATEGY §6` isolation harness; it is
  applied to `memberships` and `roles` with all four proofs plus a direct-SQL RLS probe.
  Integration tests run against an embedded PostgreSQL with no Docker dependency.
- Toolchain: workspace packages now emit `dist/` and are consumed as compiled JavaScript at
  runtime (tests still resolve them to TypeScript source through vitest aliases). This is
  what makes `pnpm run build`, `openapi:export` and the entry-point smoke check pass.

## Conventions

- `docs/` remains the authoritative documentation source.
- Phase outputs must be self-verifying and must not contradict `PROJECT_CONTRACT.md` or `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Implementation for later phases starts from this foundation only.
- A phase is `COMPLETE` only when `pnpm run verify` exits 0 on a clean checkout.
